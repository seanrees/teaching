This repository contains simple exercises I've used to help folks I know
learn Python and computer science topics.

The general approach I take:
  1) Explore the concept(s) and syntax on a whiteboard.
  2) Give the person interested in learning a skeleton of code and a unit test.
  3) Have the person complete the code until the unit test passes.
  4) Pile more on. :)

This is an adaptation of an approach used by Dr. Clint Staley[1], but geared for
folks who aren't ensconced in a full classroom setting.

Contributions welcome :)
